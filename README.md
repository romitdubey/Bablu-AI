## 📌 Problem Statement
 
**Problem Statement 1 – Weave AI magic with Groq**

---

## 🎯 Objective

Our project solves a critical gap for students and job-seekers, especially those who are introverted or lack access to mock interview support, by providing a personalized, AI-powered virtual mock interview experience.

**Many candidates struggle with:**

- Interview anxiety and nervousness

- Lack of constructive feedback

- Difficulty finding relevant practice opportunities tailored to specific job roles

- Inability to analyze their own performance (e.g., where they hesitate, get distracted, or lose confidence)

**This platform empowers users to:**

- Upload their resume and a job description (JD) of interest

- Get customized interview questions based on their own profile and the job role

**Value Provided:**

- Helps introverted or underconfident candidates practice interviews in a safe, judgment-free space

- Offers quantitative and visual feedback that traditional mock interviews can't provide

- Reduces interview preparation anxiety

- Bridges the gap between self-preparation and real interview experience

### Your Approach:  
#### Why you chose this problem  
We chose this problem because interview anxiety, lack of preparation, and limited access to realistic practice environments are some of the biggest hurdles students and early-career professionals face. As a team of tech enthusiasts passionate about AI for empowerment, we wanted to create a platform that democratizes interview readiness — especially for introverts and candidates who may not have access to formal coaching or peer support.

Mock interviews are usually human-led, time-consuming, and limited in feedback. Our vision was to use generative AI, real-time analytics, and virtual simulation to offer a scalable, intelligent alternative that’s personalized, accessible, and judgment-free.

🧠 Key Challenges We Addressed:

##### Resume & JD Understanding:

Challenge: Extracting structured data from unstructured documents.

Solution: We used Groq’s LLM APIs for smart parsing and semantic understanding of resumes and job descriptions.

##### Human-Like Interview Simulation:

Challenge: Making the virtual interviewer engaging and life-like.

Solution: Integrated ReadyPlayer.me avatars with lip-sync and speech synthesis to mimic a real HR interviewer.

#### 💡 Brainstorms, Pivots & Breakthroughs:

- Initially, we focused only on text-based interviews, but feedback from testers made us realize that visual and voice cues are essential to mimic real-world pressure. This led to the integration of 3D avatars and groq api for interview.
